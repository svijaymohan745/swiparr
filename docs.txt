API Info
Content Types
The API supports responses in both XML and JSON, and clients can request one or the other using the standard Accept HTTP header. The default is XML, so JSON will only be returned if it's explicitly requested (Accept: application/json). New applications should use JSON.

Throughout the docs, it's common for a examples to be given in JSON only since the JSON response would be preferred for new applications.

Headers
PMS accept a variety of custom headers that follow the pattern X-Plex-{name}. The full set of headers isn't enumerated here since some may only apply to certain endpoints, but common headers that can be included on all requests include:

Header	Description	Sample
X-Plex-Client-Identifier	An opaque identifier unique to the client	abc123
X-Plex-Token	An authentication token, obtained from plex.tv	XXXXXXXXXXXX
X-Plex-Product	The name of the client product	Plex for Roku
X-Plex-Version	The version of the client application	2.4.1
X-Plex-Platform	The platform of the client	Roku
X-Plex-Platform-Version	The version of the platform	4.3 build 1057
X-Plex-Device	A relatively friendly name for the client device	Roku 3
X-Plex-Model	A potentially less friendly identifier for the device model	4200X
X-Plex-Device-Vendor	The device vendor	Roku
X-Plex-Device-Name	A friendly name for the client	Living Room TV
X-Plex-Marketplace	The marketplace on which the client application is distributed	googlePlay
X-Plex-Client-Identifier is typically required, as is X-Plex-Token for authentication.

There's no standard way to send non-ASCII values as HTTP headers. We attempt to recognize and parse UTF-8 and ISO-8859-1. If you're sending something that may include non-ASCII characters (often X-Plex-Device-Name), use UTF-8 if possible.

These are referred to as headers throughout documentation, but all X-Plex- headers can also be sent as query string arguments.

Auth
Most endpoints require token based authentication, and the token is expected to be sent in the X-Plex-Token header. Tokens are obtained from plex.tv. See the Authenticating with Plex section.

Paths and Keys
Many parts of the API reference things that can be fetched by their key. These keys follow a sort of relative URL resolution pattern. Some examples will help clarify.

For a request to /library/sections that includes an item with a key of home in the response, that item can be fetched at /library/sections/home.
For a request to /library/sections/home that includes an item with a key of /library/metadata/deadbeef in the response, that item can be fetched at /library/metadata/deadbeef.
We say this follows a "sort of" relative URL resolution pattern because all requests are treated as though they have a trailing slash.

/library/sections/ + home => /library/sections/home
/library/sections + home => /library/sections/home
/library/sections + /library/sections/home => /library/sections/home
Just like URL resolution, keys may contain absolute URLs as well, especially absolute https://... URLs or custom view://... URLs. In these cases the key resolved by simply using it, the parent is irrelevant.

Also note that the features described in this API can generally be present at a different paths. The /media/providers path defines where all features can be found. Note that a PMS can contain multiple providers which will be enumerated here. For simplicity, these docs use the most common, default paths. But when we say that /library/sections/{id} is part of the API, what we really mean is that a endpoint exists which is composed of the key for the content feature and the key for the library section.

Finally, it's worth noting that many paths can potentially be discovered by walking API responses and fetching keys, but paths that aren't documented here aren't part of the API contract, they just happen to exist for a particular provider. For example, a particular content directory might include a directory with key={baseLibraryPath}/genre. That's not an official part of the API that's guaranteed to exist for every content directory, it's just a key that happened to exist within that content directory.

Types
Many elements throughout the API have a type attribute. These types are meant to give helpful information, such as whether something is a movie library or a TV show library. Some API elements rely on a type number so both are provided below

List of Metadata Types
Type Name	Type Number
movie	1
show	2
season	3
episode	4
trailer	5
person	7
artist	8
album	9
track	10
clip	12
photo	13
photoalbum	14
playlist	15
playlistfolder	16
collection	18
When an element has both type and key attributes, the type describes what will be returned when fetching that key. Some types will return a list of other elements. That list may have a Meta element describing the specific types within the list. Consider the following examples:

[
  {
    "key": "/foo",
    "type": "movie",
    "title": "A Movie"
  },
  {
    "key": "/bar",
    "type": "collection",
    "title": "My Favorite Movies"
  },
  {
    "key": "/baz",
    "type": "show",
    "title": "A Show"
  }
]
In each case, the type describes what will be returned when fetching the key. One exception is the /children key for parents like shows and seasons. It will return a list of children even though the type describes the parent.

Some elements may also include an optional subtype attribute. The subtype is meant to be a refinement of the type, not a completely different type. One test is trying to explain the type in natural language. type="clip" subtype="news" passes the test that "This is a clip, a news clip specifically." Another test is considering the client UI. A client should be functional if it ignores the subtype, and optimized if it respects it. If type="track" subtype="podcast", a client can successfully play the podcast in an audio player based purely on the type, but it may tweak the display or which advanced playback controls are visible based on the subtype.

Sources
Source URIs and attributes make it possible to uniquely reference content outside the local server context without requiring a fixed url. This might be desirable when showing related albums from a friend's shared media server, building a universal play queue, or returning aggregated hubs that span multiple providers. Source components are immutable and act as pointers to a single item or directory in the Plex ecosystem.

A source URI from a media server uses the server scheme while a cloud provider uses the provider scheme.

server://{SERVER_ID}/{PROVIDER_ID}/{PATH}
provider://{PROVIDER_ID}/{PATH}
As a single regular expression, that's:

/^(server|provider):\/\/([a-fA-F0-9-]+)?\/?([^/]+)([^\?]+)\??(.*)?/
The server id is the server's machineIdentifier. The provider id is the provider's identifier. The rest of the path represents the path of the content at the provider and may include additional query parameters like X-Plex- headers or media query syntax for sorts and filters.

Some examples may be helpful:

server://546684a3d18ac5c39037360ec9ce900b7af9cc36/com.plexapp.plugins.library/library/metadata/2814936
provider://tv.plex.provider.podcasts/library/sections/audio/all
The source attribute has the same structure as the source URI, but omits the path.

{SOURCE_TYPE}://{SOURCE_ID}/{PROVIDER_ID?}
/^(server|provider):\/\/([a-fA-F0-9-]+)?\/?([^/]+)$/
source="server://546684a3d18ac5c39037360ec9ce900b7af9cc36/com.plexapp.plugins.library"
source="provider://tv.plex.provider.podcasts"
Source attributes can be used as a base and combined with key or other root-relative path components to construct unique source URIs.

Pagination
Many endpoints that return a list of items support pagination. Additionally some endpoints will force pagination and limit number of elements returned if the client attempts to request all items. To request a specific subset of data, add two headers to specify the starting offset and the number of desired items.

X-Plex-Container-Start - The desired starting offset
X-Plex-Container-Size - The desired number of items
Both headers should be sent in order to request paginated content. Note that it's possible to request a size of 0 on supported endpoints in order to learn the total size without actually getting any content.

The response must be checked to see if the response is in fact paginated. The response might not be paginated at all, or it might include a different number of items than what was requested. A paginated response will include the headers:

X-Plex-Container-Start - The offset of the first returned item
X-Plex-Container-Total-Size - The total size of the collection (optional but typically present)
The response body will also typically include pagination info. If the response is a MediaContainer, then it will have offset and size attributes representing the start index and the number of items in the current response along with an optional totalSize attribute for the total number of elements in the collection.

HTTP/1.1 200 OK
X-Plex-Container-Start: 2
X-Plex-Container-Total-Size: 5
Content-Type: application/xml

{
  "MediaContainer": {
    "size": 3,
    "totalSize": 5,
    "offset": 2,
    "Metadata" : [
      …
    ]
  }
}
Rather than requesting a page starting at an index, it is also possible in some lists to request a page centered on a specific item in the list.

X-Plex-Container-Focus-Key - The key of an item to center on
X-Plex-Container-Size - The desired number of items
The requested size is respected regardless of the position of the focus item in the list. If the item is at the start of the list and 10 items are requested, 9 items in the response will be after the item. If the item is in the middle of the list and 10 items are requested, 4 items will be before the item and 5 items will be after.

Endpoints that support rich media queries also have a limit parameter that interacts with pagination. Sending limit in a query string limits the desired number of items, much like the X-Plex-Container-Size header. There are two major differences:

When using limit, the total size of the collection is not returned. The minimum of the limit and the actual total size will be returned as the total size.
The request may be more efficient when using limit, since the total size doesn't have to be known.
If the total size of the collection isn't needed, use limit, since the request may be more efficient.

Note that limit and X-Plex-Container-Size aren't mutually exclusive. You can page within the results that are bounded by the limit. If you want a total of 1000 items from a collection of many thousands of items, but you want to page through them 20 at a time, you'd use limit=1000&X-Plex-Container-Size=20&X-Plex-Container-Start=0.

API Versioning
PMS has never used API versioning before the creation of this document. The first published API is considered 1.0 with the API prior to publication considered 0.0. A client species its version via the X-Plex-Pms-Api-Version header on requests. If no header is provided, the version 0.0 is assumed.

API Changes
1.0.0 (Supported in PMS >= 1.41.9)

Added /downloadQueue endpoints.

Public release of API.

The includeFields parameter has been renamed to includeOptionalFields. The includeFields parameter now means "include only these fields" where in the past it meant "please add these fields you wouldn't normally include." This was changed to be consistent with the cloud provider API.

1.1.0 (Supported in PMS >= 1.42.0)

Added ability to filter '/media/providers/metadata' endpoint by metadata types (PM-3702)
Changed types in /playlists/{playlistId}/items to array of integers.
Document the /photo/:/transcode endpoints
Fixed serialization of MetadataType objects for '/media/providers/metadata' calls.
1.1.1 (Supported in PMS >= 1.42.2)

Added 'metadataAgentProviderGroupId' query param to create and edit library section (PM-3577)
Fixed Add library section method type.
1.2.0 (Supported in PMS >= 1.43.0)

Added 'squareArt' as additional element type for image assets (PM-2959)
Added /media/providers/metadata endpoints (PM-1012)
Added delete method for /library/metadata/{id}/{element} (PM-4094)
Added documentation for Metadata-type Media Providers (PM-3051)
Response Customization
Many endpoints allow the data that is included in the response to be tailored to exactly what the client wants. This is possible by either specifying things that should be excluded or the set of things that should be included. PMS's ability to include/exclude elements and fields is currently limited but expanding so this should be used with care.

Attributes can be customized by using a query string arg of either excludeFields or includeFields. This single parameter should be a comma-separated list of attribute names. For example, a request with excludeFields=summary,tagline is asking for the summary and title attributes to be left off any metadata items while the includeFields parameter indicated that only the specified fields should be included.

Child elements can be customized by using a query string arg of either excludeElements or includeElements. This single parameter should be a comma-separated list of element names. For example, a request with excludeElements=Media is asking for the Media elements to be omitted while the includeElements parameter indicated that only the specified elements should be included.

In addition to the above are the parameters includeOptionalFields and includeOptionalElements. These indicate that the fields/elements which are not normally included should be included in this request. One example is includeOptionalElements=musicAnalysis on metadata will include the musicAnalysis parameter which can be large and typically not needed by a client.

Trimming the response to only include what a client will actually use can result in much better performance, especially in large collections. Increasingly these are being used to select which data is fetched from the database. So if a client knows it will only ever use a few parameters from a request, it should specify those with includeFields.

Note that these inclusions/exclusions are treated as requests, not guarantees. Some endpoints will disregard them completely, and others may ignore them for specific items and insist on returning data that the client didn't necessarily ask for.

Media Providers
Media providers are general purpose entities which supply media to Plex clients. Their API describes the Plex Media Server API, via a set of features on the "root" endpoint of the provider. Media provider can be hosted by a media server or in the cloud, linked to a specific Plex account. This section explains media providers generally, and then provides the specific server-hosted APIs around media providers.

Client Guide to Media Providers
The philosophy behind media providers in general is to allow a common API between cloud servers and PMS, since the APIs are nearly identical to a normal PMS. The general guidelines are:

Consume /media/providers instead of /library/sections

The new providers endpoint give you a list of all providers exported by a server and their features. Remember that the library itself is considered a (very rich) provider! This change will also require changing the client to not hardwire paths on the server, but rather read them from the feature keys directly (e.g. scrobble and rating endpoints).

Gate management functionality on the manage feature

Server libraries allow management (e.g. media deletion). The correct way to gate this functionality is via the manage feature.

Make sure key construction is correct for things like genre lists

For example, /library/sections/x/genre returns a relative key for each genre, but there's nothing which says that the key can't be an absolute URL. This is why servers pass back fastKey separately so as to not break clients which don't do key construction correctly. Media providers do not pass back fastKey, but assume clients will be doing correct key construction.

Don't call /library/sections/X/filters|sorts

You can get all that information (and more) in a single call by hitting /library/sections/X?includeDetails=1. Media providers include the extra information by default.

Respect the Type keys in /library/sections/x

The top-level type pivots have their own keys, which should be used over the old "just append /all to the path and add the type" approach. Not only is this more flexible, it also allows for "virtual" pivots, like music videos inside a music library.

Look for the skipChildren/skipParent attributes for shows

Because of things like Podcasts, single-season shows can now be made to skip seasons. This is indicated by a skipChildren attribute on the show, or a skipParent attribute on an episode. If this is set on a show, the client should use /grandchildren instead of /children in the show's key.

Features
The list of supported features, along with the API endpoints each feature represents is shown in the following list. Note that each feature can define a custom endpoint URL, so it doesn't have to match the server API exactly.

search: This feature implies that it supports search via the provided key.

metadata: This feature implies that it supports metadata endpoint. For example, if the key were /library/metadata then the endpoints /library/metadata/X, /library/metadata/X/children and /library/metadata/X/grandchildren would be supported. This endpoint family allows browsing a hierarchical tree of media (e.g. show to episodes, or artist to tracks).

content: This feature implies that the provider exposes a content catalog, in the form of libraries to browse (grid of content), or discover (via hubs). Each entry in the content feature can contain:

hubKey: This implies it supports a discovery endpoint with hubs.
key: This implies it supports a content catalog.
icon: Optional, specifies the icon used for a content directory.
Each content feature can contain one or both of these keys, depending on the structure. More details on the various combinations are provided below.

match: The match feature is used to match a piece of media to the provider's content catalog via a set of hints. As a specific example, you might pass in a title hint of "Attack of the 50 Foot Woman" and a year hint of 1958 for the movie type. The provider would then use all the hints to attempt to match to entries in its catalog.

manage: The manage feature implies a whole host of endpoints around changing data inside a library (e.g. editing fields, customizing artwork, etc.). This feature is generally only available on an actual server and generally only to the admin.

timeline: The timeline feature implies that the provider wants to receive timeline (playback notifications) requests from a client at the endpoint defined by key. The feature may additionally specify the scrobbleKey and unscrobbleKey attributes, which represent the endpoints which allow marking a piece of media played or unplayed.

rate: This feature implies the provider supports the endpoint which allows rating content.

playqueue: This feature implies the provider supports the play queue family of endpoints. The flavor attribute further specifies the subset; the only supported flavor is currently full.

playlist: This feature implies the provider supports the playlist family of endpoints. If readonly is set, that means that the provider only allows listing and playing playlists (via play queue API), not actually creating or editing them.

subscribe: This provider allows media subscriptions to be created. If the flavor is record then media can be recorded from this library (such as DVR). If the flavor is download then the user is allowed to download from this library.

promoted: This feature allows the provider to supply an endpoint that will return a collection of "promoted" hubs that many clients show on a user's home screen.

continuewatching: This feature allows the provider to supply an endpoint that will return a hub for merging into a global Continue Watching hub.

collection: This feature implies the provider supports the collection family of endpoints.

actions

removeFromContinueWatching - Action to remove an item from continue watching
imagetranscoder - This feature implies the provider supports the image transcoder endpoints used to scale images for clients where memory and processor is at a premium

queryParser - This feature implies the provider supports the media queries language below

grid - This feature implies the provider supports displaying metadata in a grid over time (such as live TV)

Home discovery and browsable libraries
Shown in the example in /media/providers, in this media provider the first content directory is an item with only hubKey, meaning it only providers discovery hubs. This is the set of hubs covering the whole library which contains continue watching, recently added, recommendations, etc. It's essentially "landing page" for the provider.

The subsequent directories also have a browse key, which means they provide a list view of the content with options for filtering and sorting. EPG providers may have only the key and no hubKey.

Minimal provider
There's no requirement to provide the content feature, given that there are two other ways to access content within a provider: search and match. The former can contribute to global search, whereas the latter is used for things like the DVR engine; once media subscriptions are set up, they look for matching content using the match feature, and examined using the metadata feature.

Deeper Hierarchies
If you examine an app like Spotify, you'll see many of the concepts here apply to their content hierarchy. Their content screens are either grids or hubs. But one notable difference is that the content hierarchy runs a bit deeper than the examples we've examined thus far. For example, one of the top-level selections is "Genres & Moods". Diving into one of the genres leads to a discovery area with different hubs for popular playlists, artists, and albums from the genre. Selecting a mood leads to a grid with popular playlists for the mood. In order to support this sort of hierarchy, we need an extension to the regular library, which is a content directory. This allows us to nest content, without losing any of the power and features—for example, the grid with popular playlists could list filters and sorts specific for that grid. This is power you simply don't have with the old channel architecture.

Extensions to regular libraries
This section examines extensions to plain libraries which content providers can use, and which clients need to be aware of.

Nested content directories: In regular libraries, there are fixed types of directories (e.g. shows, or music albums). In content providers, we want to have the ability to display other types of things (e.g. stations, or moods, or genres) as first-class things in a grid or discovery layout. Here's an example of what a nested content directory looks like. Given the type of content, the client knows that this directory should be treated like a content directory feature entry.

{
  "Directory":[
    {
      "key":"foo",
      "hubKey":"foo2",
      "type":"content",
      "aspectRatio":"1:1",
      "title":"Genres and Moods"
    }
  ]
}
Aspect ratio hint: Because the entities listed in content directories can be arbitrary, it's important to tell the client some information about how they should be displayed. The thumb attribute contains no information about aspect ratio, so clients make assumptions based upon known types (e.g. movies are 2:3, episode thumbs are 16:9, etc.). This attributes allows the provider to specify exactly the aspect ratio of the thing being displayed.

Metadata Providers
This section describes the specific Media Providers which supply the metadata feature. These providers can be created and used in Plex Media Server to supply metadata to items inside Movie and TV Show libraries (music libraries are currently not supported).

Common Request Headers
There are a few headers which are common to both the Metadata and Match features. These can be passed as either headers or query parameters.

Header	Support Required?	Description
X-Plex-Language	No	IETF language tag including the region subtag (e.g. 'en-US', 'de-DE'). Used for localization.
X-Plex-Country	No	ISO 3166 two-letter country code. Used primarily to define the country for certification data, or can be used to determine release dates for the specific country.
X-Plex-Container-Size	Yes	For paged requests. This determines what the maximum container size should be of a single response.
X-Plex-Container-Start	Yes	For paged requests. This determines the starting index for the paged request.
Response Paging
Certain responses may contain a large number of objects. The consumer may want to limit the size of the MediaContainer by paging through them using the X-Plex-Container-Size and X-Plex-Container-Start headers/params. Responses should them limit the object count inside the MediaContainer to X-Plex-Container-Size and start at the index provided by X-Plex-Container-Start.

See the Pagination section for more details on how paging works.

The only two endpoints that require mandatory paging are the Metadata /children and /grandchildren endpoints as these will potentially contain many items. Passing no paging headers here should only return the first 20 Metadata objects.

Common return codes
It is important to return the correct HTTP return codes.

Code	Common Name	Description
200	OK	An response for an item or match is successfully returned
404	Not Found	If an item with the requested ratingKey is not found (Metadata feature only)
400	Bad Request	A request was made which cannot be fulfilled because the request is malformed
500	Internal Server Error	A request was made which cannot be fulfilled because the server encountered an internal error
Response Customization (Optional)
There may be cases where a reduced response is wanted, i.e. we only want to return specific attributes or exclude specific attributes. These are handled with includeFields, excludeFields, includeElements and excludeElements.

Information on its use can be found in the Response Customization.

You may wish to add support for this to keep response sizes down, however it is not required and you can safely ignore when these parameters are passed.

Metadata Feature
This is a path to retrieve metadata for a specific piece of content by its id.

It is called by making a GET request to the path defined by the Metadata feature inside the root of your provider with the ratingKey of the metadata item.

For example, the request may be something like GET http://localhost/library/metadata/tmdb-movie-123 which should return a Metadata Object for the item with the ratingKey of "tmdb-movie-123".

See some Example Responses

Supported Query Parameters
There are some query parameters available to media provider to augment the responses. Not all of these are required to be supported by all providers, support requirement is detailed in the below table.

Param	Type	Support Required?	Description
includeChildren	integer (1/0)	Yes (TV Shows/Seasons only)	Returns a Children Object when the metadata type has direct child objects (e.g. a TV Show should return Season Children)
episodeOrder	string	No	When making a request that returns seasons in the response, pass back the appropriate season items for the requested SeasonType id. It is expected that if no seasons exist for the requested episodeOrder, that no season data should be returned.
Image endpoint (Recommended)
The Metadata feature should also provide a /images path for calls to specific items, e.g. /library/metadata/tmdb-movie-123/images. This endpoint should return a MediaContainer object containing and Image Array of all the available image assets for that item.

Example:

{
  "MediaContainer": {
    "offset": 0,
    "totalSize": 3,
    "identifier": "tv.plex.provider.metadata",
    "size": 3,
    "Image": [
      {
        "type": "coverPoster",
        "url": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/original/qk3eQ8jW4opJ48gFWYUXWaMT4l.jpg",
      },
      {
        "type": "background",
        "url": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/original/3uE9SUywNbj1qSAuYCGgbTTYku5.jpg",
      },
      {
        "type": "clearLogo",
        "url": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/original/rIi0lY2UftYuKDJ4OlIefDdijve.png",
      }
    ]
  }
}
Children and Grandchildren Requests
For items which contain child items, like TV Shows and Seasons, these types should also respond to requests for /children and /grandchildren, e.g. /library/metadata/tmdb-show-123/children.

For TV Shows and Seasons this should return a MediaContainer object with an array of Metadata Objects for their Seasons and Episodes respectively.

It is required that these two endpoints support paged requests via the X-Plex-Container-Size and X-Plex-Container-Start headers/params.

Match Feature
This is a path to retrieve potential matches to metadata items based on contextual hints passed in your request body. This should return a MediaContainer Object possibly containing multiple Metadata objects (by default should only return the best result only).

It is called by making a POST request to the path defined by the Match feature inside the root of your provider.

This may be where it is useful supporting Response Customization as match responses don't always need to contain the full Metadata object responses.

A request body is required which can contain the attributes listed below.

Attribute	Type	Support Required?	Optional	Description
type	integer	Yes	No	The numeric metadata type for the requested match. See Metadata Types Table
title	string	Yes	No*	A title for the item. *Movies and TV Shows only.
parentTitle	string	Yes	No*	A title for the TV Show. *Seasons only.
grandparentTitle	string	Yes	No*	A title for the TV Show. *Episodes only.
includeChildren	integer (1/0)	Yes (TV Shows/Seasons only)	Yes*	Returns a Children Object when the metadata type has direct child objects (e.g. a TV Show should return Season Children). *Is only optional for Movie and Episode types.
episodeOrder	string	No	Yes	When making a request that returns seasons in the response, pass back the appropriate season items for the requested SeasonType id. It is expected that if no seasons exist for the requested episodeOrder, that no season data should be returned.
year	integer	Yes	Yes	The release year for the requested match.
guid	string	Yes	Yes	An external id which can help matching precisely (e.g. `tvdb://12345)
index	integer	Yes	Yes*	For Seasons, the season number. For Episodes, the episode number.
parentIndex	integer	Yes	Yes*	For Episodes, the season number.
filename	string	No	Yes	The relative path for the underlying media file. For TV Shows and Seasons this will return the first file found. e.g. /Movies/Back to the Future (1985).mp4
date	string	Yes	Yes*	When matching an TV Episode, if index and parentIndex are not available, a date must be passed representing the air date of the episode.
manual	integer (1/0)	Yes	Yes	When a value of 1 is passed, the response should contain an array of the best matches for the request ordered by highest to lowest confidence. When this value is not passed or is 0, only the best match should be returned.
includeAdult	integer (1/0)	No	Yes	If your provider supports explicit/adult content this value should be taken into consideration when returning responses and any explicit results should be filtered out unless a value of 1 is passed.

MediaProvider Response
This document describes the JSON response schema for Plex-compatible metadata-specific Media Providers.

The root of the Media Provider must return some necessary attributes which define a metadata provider.

MediaProvider
Field	Type	Required	Description
identifier	string	Yes	Unique identifier for this media provider
title	string	Yes	A human readable title for the media provider
version	string	No	The version of the API being called
Feature	array	Yes	Array containing the features provided by the media provider
Types Array (Required)
This defines what metadata types are supported by the provider.

Please note that is recommended to support one specific metadata parent type per provider as this will make it easier for consumers to combine this provider with others inside Plex Media Server. This is because in order to combine providers, each provider in a combine group must support the types the other supports as well. Limiting the scope of types will make it more widely compatible.

If you wish to support both movie and TV Shows, consider creating two separate providers. This isn't a hard requirement but is recommended.

When supporting TV Shows, it is necessary to add a type for TV Shows, Seasons and Episodes (i.e. types 2, 3 and 4).

Field	Type	Required	Description
type	integer	Yes	The metadata type represented by its numeric value (see mapping table below)
Scheme	array	Yes	Array defining the GUID-scheme (the prefix) for items returned by this provider
Scheme Array (Required)
Field	Type	Required	Description
scheme	string	Yes	The GUID-scheme. Should be identical to the provider identifier.
Metadata Types Table
Custom metadata provider currently support a subset of the full metadata types outline in the Metadata Types section.

Type Name	Type Number
movie	1
show	2
season	3
episode	4
Feature Array (Required)
A feature, as its name implies, defines a feature available to the specific provider.

Field	Type	Required	Description
type	string	Yes	Feature type (see feature table below)
key	string	Yes	API endpoint path to call this feature
Available Features
Type	Required	Description
metadata	Yes	Path to retrieve metadata for a specific piece of content by its id. See Metadata Feature section.
match	Yes	Path to return a potential match for a specific piece of content using contextual hints. See Match Feature section.

        "type": "match",
        "key": "/library/metadata/matches"
      }
    ]
  }
}
Defining an identifier
Custom metadata providers need to provide an identifier using a scheme with the tv.plex.agents.custom. prefix. A custom provider can choose its own scheme as long as it is prefixed with this value, for example a provider for a custom TheMovieDB implementation might use a scheme like:

tv.plex.agents.custom.johnz.tmdb

It is important to note that you should try and keep the identifier unique as there is no guarantee that it will be the only provider added to a Plex user's server and could conflict with a another existing provider already in use. So avoid using very generic suffixes like tmdb, tvdb, etc.

The characters allowed for your suffix is very strict and can only contain ASCII letters, numbers and periods (regex [a-zA-Z0-9.]).

This identifier must be used as the scheme for the Metadata items the provider returns. See GUID Construction.

Metadata Response
This section describes the JSON response schema for Plex-compatible metadata responses from Media Providers. This does not describe the Metadata response in its entirety only what is required for Media Provider responses.

The response consists of a MediaContainer object that wraps Metadata objects representing the movie, TV show, season or episode data.

The different metadata types may have specific attributes only returned by that type. e.g. Season and episode types will have some attributes specific to their parent like parentTitle which would not be serialized by a movie or TV show type.

MediaContainer
The root object that contains metadata and pagination information.

This is a simplified MediaContainer object inside a Metadata object which provides an array of child items for the parent object (i.e. when requesting a TV Show, Children will contain the list of Seasons of that TV Show).

Note: it is expected that all the child objects be returned in this array. In some edge cases this may result in very large arrays. Please see fit to ensure your provider can handle this and simplify the child objects with only the required attributes if necessary.

Field	Type	Description
size	integer	Number of items in the Metadata array
Metadata	array	Array containing all child Metadata objects
GUID construction
Plex-compatible GUIDs are constructed out of the following components:

{scheme}://{metadataType}/{ratingKey}

For an item from the Plex metadata provider this will look something like this:

plex://movie/5d7768244de0ee001fcc7fed

Scheme component
Custom metadata providers need to provide a GUID in this same format using a scheme with the tv.plex.agents.custom. prefix. The scheme should match the metadata provider's identifier (see Defining an identifier), for example a provider for a custom TheMovieDB implementation might use a scheme like:

tv.plex.agents.custom.johnz.tmdb

metadataType component
This should just be the string representation of the metadata type being returned, i.e. movie, show, season or episode.

ratingKey component
This value should match the ratingKey attribute on the metadata item and is what is used when making a metadata request to the provider (e.g. http://localhost/library/metadata/{ratingKey}).

The ratingKey can constist of ASCII letters, numbers, dashes and underscores (regex [a-zA-Z0-9_-]).

Custom GUID examples
Some valid GUIDs could look like this:

tv.plex.agents.custom.johnz.tmdb://movie/tmdb-movie-19934
tv.plex.agents.custom.barkley.tvdb://show/78874
tv.plex.agents.custom.finn.imdb://movie/tt0379786

Media Queries
Media queries are a querystring-based filtering language used to select subsets of media. The language is rich, and can express complex expressions for media selection, as well as sorting and grouping.

Fields
Queries reference fields, which can be of a few types:

integer: numbers
boolean: true/false
tag: integers representing tag IDs.
string: strings
date: epoch seconds
language: string in ISO639-2b format.
These fields are detailed in Field elements in the section description endpoint (e.g. /library/sections/X?includeDetails=1).

Operators
Given that media queries are expressible using querystrings, the operator syntax might look a bit quirky, because a) they have to include the = character, and b) characters to the left of the equal sign usually have to be URI encoded.

Operators are defined per type:

integer: = (equals), != (not equals), >>= (greater than), <<= (less than), <= (less than or equals), >= (greater than or equals)
boolean: =0 (false) and =1 (true)
tag: = (is) and != (is not)
string: = (contains), != (does not contain), == (equals), !== (does not equal), <= (begins with), >= (ends with)
date: = (equals), != (not equals), >>= (after), <<= (before)
language: = (equals), != (not equals)
Relative Values and Units
For some types, values can be specified as relative. For dates, epoch seconds can be specified as relative to “now” as follows: +N (in N seconds from now and -N (N seconds ago).

In addition, the following unit suffixes can be used on date values:

m: minutes
h: hours
d: days
w: weeks
mon: months
y: years
For example, >>=-3y means “within the last 3 years”.

Field Scoping
Some media is organized hierarchically (e.g. shows), and in those cases, many fields are common to different elements in the hierarchy (e.g. show title vs episode title). The following rules are used to resolve field references.

A type parameter must be included to specify the result type.
Any non-qualified field is defaulted to refer to the result type.
In order to refer to other levels of the hierarchy, use the scoping operator, e.g. show.title or episode.year. A query may be comprised of multiple fields from different levels of the hierarchy.
the sourceType parameter may be used to change the default level to which fields refer. For example, type=4&sourceType=2&title==24 means “all episodes where the show title is 24”.
Sorting
The sort parameter is used to indicate an ordering on results. Typically, the sort value is a field (including optional scoping). The : character is used to indicate additional features of the sort, and the , character is used to include multiple fields to the sort.

For example, sort=title,index means “sort first by title ascending, then by index”. Sort features are:

desc: indicates a descending sort.
nullsLast: indicates that null values are sorted last.
Sort features may be mixed and matched, e.g. sort=title,index:desc.

Grouping
The group parameter is used to group results by a field, similar to the SQL feature group by. For example, when listing popular tracks, we use the query type=10&sort=ratingCount:desc&group=title, because we don't want multiple tracks with the same name (e.g. same track on different albums) showing up.

Limits
The limit parameter is used to limit the number of results returned. Because it's implemented on top of the SQL limit operator, it currently only operates at the level of the type returned. In other words, type=10&limit=100 will return at most 100 tracks, but you can't select tracks from a limit of 10 albums.

Boolean Operators
Given the nature of querystrings, it makes a lot of sense to interpret the & character as a boolean AND operator. For example rating=10&index=5 means “rating is 10 AND index is 5”.

We leverage the , operator to signify the boolean OR operator. SO rating=1,2,3 means “rating is 1 OR 2 OR 3. Given standard precedence rules, rating=1,2,3&index=5 is parsed as (rating = 1 or rating = 2 or rating = 3) and index = 5).

Complex Expressions
There's only so many expressions you can form using vanilla querystring-to-boolean mapping (essentially, “ANDs of ORs”). In order to fully represent complex boolean expressions, there are a few synthetic additions:

push=1 and pop=1: These are the equivalent of opening and closing parenthesis.
or=1: These is an explicit OR operator.
As an example: push=1&index=1&or=1&rating=2&pop=1&duration=10 parses into (index = 1 OR rating = 2) AND duration = 10. This could not be expressed by the simplified syntax above.

Happy query building!

Profile Augmentations
The universal transcode endpoint supports the following header or query string parameter: X-Plex-Client-Profile-Extra.

The value of this parameter is url-encoded. When url-decoded, it consists of a string expressed in the following (poor man's) BNF grammar:

<ProfileExtension> ::= <Directive> "+" <Directive>*
<Directive> :: = <Verb> <Arguments>
<Verb> ::= "add-direct-play-profile" | "add-limitation" | "add-transcode-target-codec" | "append-transcode-target-codec" | "add-transcode-target" | "add-settings"
<Arguments> ::= "(" (<Name> "=" <Value>) "&")*
<Name> ::= <Text>
<Value> ::= <Text>
add-direct-play-profile
This directive augments the set of Direct Play profiles in the client profile. The following parameters are required:

type = "videoProfile" | "musicProfile" | "photoProfile" | "subtitleProfile"
container = * or a comma-separated list of containers
videoCodec = * or a comma-separated list of video codecs
audioCodec = * or a comma-separated list of audio codecs
subtitleCodec = * or a comma-separated list of subtitle formats
* means to use all existing matching values in the profile. At least one of the videoCodec, audioCodec and subtitleCodec parameters must not be *.

add-direct-play-profile example
To add ac3 as a video audio codec for mp4 and mov containers:

add-direct-play-profile(type=videoProfile&container=mp4,mov&videoCodec=*&audioCodec=ac3&subtitleCodec=*)
add-limitation
This directive adds a scoped limitation to the profile. The following parameters are required:

scope = "videoContainer" | "musicContainer" | "photoContainer" | "videoCodec" | "videoAudioCodec" | "musicCodec" | "subtitleCodec" | "transcodeTarget"
scopeName = the name of the relevant container or codec
type = "match" | "notMatch" | "upperBound" | "lowerBound"
name = the name of the limitation
The following parameters are optional:

isRequired = true|false (default is false)
allStreams = true|false (default is false)
replace = true|false (default is false)
If the replace parameter is true, the limitation will replace any similarly scoped limitations (i.e. identical scope and scopeName. If false, the new limitation will simply add itself to the list of limitations.

Exactly one of the following three parameters is required:

value = the value of the limitation
substring = the substring of the limitation
regex = the regex of the limitation
The transcodeTarget scope exists to attach a limitation to a transcode target. This allows clients to tell the MDE to select a specific transcode target for a context/protocol pair, based on specific information about the media itself. When multiple transcode targets match, the first one in the profile will be selected.

add-limitation examples
To add a limitation on ac3 audio tracks in video media specifying a maximum of 6 channels:

add-limitation(scope=videoAudioCodec&scopeName=ac3&type=upperBound&name=audio.channels&value=6)
To add a limitation on ac3 audio tracks in video media specifying a maximum bitrate:

add-limitation(scope=videoAudioCodec&scopeName=ac3&type=upperBound&name=audio.bitrate&value=160)
To add a limitation on h264 video specifying a maximum level:

add-limitation(scope=videoCodec&scopeName=h264&type=upperBound&name=video.level&value=40&isRequired=true)
To add a limitation to a transcode target:

add-limitation(scope=transcodeTarget&scopeName=MyTranscodeProfile&type=upperBound&name=audio.channels&value=2)
add-transcode-target-codec
This directive adds additional codecs to the beginning of the audioCodec and/or subtitleCodec lists for the specified transcode target. The following parameters are required:

type = "videoProfile" | "musicProfile" | "photoProfile" | "subtitleProfile"
Either id or context and protocol are required:

id = a transcode target identifier
context = a transcode context ("streaming" | "static")
protocol = a protocol ("hls" | "http" | "slss" ... )
At least one of the following parameters are also required:

videoCodec = a comma-separated list of videoCodecs, which are added to the set of video codecs on the target.
audioCodec = a comma-separated list of audioCodecs, which are added to the set of audio codecs on the target.
subtitleCodec = a comma-separated list of audioCodecs, which are added to the set of subtitle codecs on the target.
add-transcode-target-codec example
To add ac3 as an additional transcode target option to a HTTP Live Streaming target:

add-transcode-target-codec(type=videoProfile&context=streaming&protocol=hls&audioCodec=ac3)
append-transcode-target-codec
This directive appends additional codecs to the end of the audioCodec and/or subtitleCodec lists for the specified transcode target. The parameters are the same as for add-transcode-target-codec.

append-transcode-target-codec(type=videoProfile&context=streaming&protocol=hls&audioCodec=dca)
add-transcode-target
This directive adds a new transcode target. If a transcode target matching the type/context/profile already exists in the profile, then this directive is ignored. The following parameters are required:

type = "videoProfile" | "musicProfile" | "photoProfile" | "subtitleProfile"
context = a transcode context ("streaming" | "static")
protocol = a protocol ("hls" | "http" | "slss" ... )
container = a container
The following parameters are optional:

id = a transcode target identifier
replace = true|false (default is false)
If the replace parameter is true, the transcode target will replace any similarly scoped transcode target (i.e. identical type, context and protocol. If false, the augmentation will fail if there is an existing transcode target.

The following parameters are required, depending on the type:

videoCodec = a video codec (required for video) or a comma-separated list of video codecs
audioCodec = an audio codec (required for music and video) or a comma-separated list of audio codecs
subtitleCodec = an subtitle codec (required for subtitles and optional for video) or a comma-separated list of subtitle codecs
add-transcode-target examples
add-transcode-target(type=videoProfile&context=streaming&protocol=http&container=mkv&videoCodec=h264&audioCodec=aac,ac3&subtitleCodec=srt)

Authenticating with Plex
Plex supports two authentication methods:

JWT Authentication (Recommended)
Plex now supports JSON Web Token (JWT) authentication that provides better security, shorter token lifespans, and improved protection against potential security breaches.

Why JWT Authentication?
The new JWT system addresses security concerns by:

Short-lived tokens: Tokens expire after 7 days
Public-key cryptography: Uses modern cryptographic standards (ED25519) for enhanced security
Better clock synchronization: Built-in timestamp validation helps devices stay in sync
How JWT Authentication Works
1. Register your public key

The new system uses a public-key authentication model where each device uploads a public key (JWK) and then requests short-lived JWT tokens. There are two ways to get started with JWT authentication:

Option 1: PIN Authentication Flow (Recommended for New Apps)

This method allows you to get JWT tokens without needing any existing tokens first. It's the preferred approach for new applications.

Step 1: Generate a PIN with JWK

POST https://clients.plex.tv/api/v2/pins
Headers:
  X-Plex-Client-Identifier: your-device-identifier

Body:
{
  "jwk": {
    "kty": "OKP",
    "crv": "Ed25519",
    "x": "your-public-key-data",
    "kid": "your-key-id",
    "alg": "EdDSA"
  },
  "strong": true
}
Step 2: User Authentication

Construct the Auth App URL and have the user authenticate:

https://app.plex.tv/auth#?clientID=<clientIdentifier>&code=<pinCode>&context%5Bdevice%5D%5Bproduct%5D=My%20Cool%20Plex%20App&forwardUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fmy-cool-plex-app.com
For 4-digit pins, you need to use the link page: https://plex.tv/link/?pin=<code>

Step 3: Exchange PIN for JWT Token

GET https://clients.plex.tv/api/v2/pins/<pinID>?deviceJWT=<signedJWT>
The signed JWT must include:

"aud": "plex.tv"
"iss": "<clientIdentifier>"
"kid" and "alg" in the header
You will get the Plex JWT token in the authToken field of the response.

Option 2: Register your public key with existing tokens (For Existing Apps)

If you already have a legacy token, you can use it to register your device for JWT authentication:

POST https://clients.plex.tv/api/v2/auth/jwk
Headers:
  X-Plex-Client-Identifier: your-device-identifier
  X-Plex-Token: your-existing-token

Body:
{
  "jwk": {
    "kty": "OKP",
    "crv": "Ed25519",
    "x": "your-public-key-data",
    "kid": "your-key-id",
    "use": "sig",
    "alg": "EdDSA"
  }
}
After registering your public key, you should follow the same steps described below to refresh your token to get your first JWT.

2. Token Refresh Process

Once registered, your device must refresh its token every 7 days using this three-step process:

Step 1: Get a Nonce

GET https://clients.plex.tv/api/v2/auth/nonce
Headers:
  X-Plex-Client-Identifier: your-device-identifier
This returns a unique nonce valid for 5 minutes:

{
  "nonce": "7c415b56-8f48-488a-98ab-847ef4460442"
}
Step 2: Create a Device JWT

Your device creates a JWT containing:

The nonce from step 1
Required scope permissions (see Scope Details below)
Audience set to plex.tv
Issuer set to your client_identifier
Signed with your device's private key
Important JWT Header Requirements:

Your JWT must include these header fields:

"kid": The key identifier from your JWK registration
"alg": Must be "EdDSA" for ED25519 signatures, or "RS256" for RSA signatures
Scope Details:

The scope field in your device JWT should contain comma-separated values for the user data you need included in the JWT:

username - Access to the user's username
email - Access to the user's email address
friendly_name - Access to the user's friendly name
restricted - Access to the user's restricted status
anonymous - Access to the user's anonymous status
joinedAt - Access to the user's account creation timestamp
Example Device JWT Header:

{
  "kid": "your-key-id",
  "alg": "EdDSA",
  "typ": "JWT"
}
Example Device JWT Payload:

{
  "nonce": "7c415b56-8f48-488a-98ab-847ef4460442",
  "scope": "username,email,friendly_name",
  "aud": "plex.tv",
  "iss": "your-client-identifier",
  "iat": 1705785603,
  "exp": 1705789203
}
Step 3: Exchange for Plex Token

POST https://clients.plex.tv/api/v2/auth/token
Headers:
  X-Plex-Client-Identifier: your-device-identifier

Body:
{
  "jwt": "your-device-signed-jwt"
}
This returns a new Plex.tv JWT valid for 7 days:

{
  "auth_token": "eyJraWQiOiJYeVRRN21seXFtVmhJcEo0U1pDZGltdXo3ZjdEYXU1Ym9MLXU2MG5JeEdJIiwidHlwIjoiSldUIiwiYWxnIjoiRWREU0EifQ..."
}
Using Your JWT Token

Once you have a JWT token, use it exactly like the old tokens in the X-Plex-Token header. Note it can be used to access any Plex.tv endpoint or your Plex Media Server instance:

GET http://your-plex-server:32400/library/sections
Headers:
  X-Plex-Token: your-jwt-token
JWT Authentication Benefits
Security Features:

Token Rotation: Automatic expiration every 7 days
Individual Revocation: Each device can be individually disabled
Cryptographic Verification: Uses industry-standard ED25519 signatures
Nonce Protection: Prevents replay attacks
Developer Experience:

Familiar Interface: Same X-Plex-Token header usage
Automatic Clock Sync: Built-in timestamp validation
Clear Error Codes: Specific error responses for different failure modes
Rate Limiting: Built-in protection against abuse
Error Handling
The JWT system provides clear error responses with specific HTTP status codes:

Common Error Responses:

498 Token Expired: Your JWT has expired and needs refresh
422 Signature Verification Failed: Invalid device signature or JWT structure
422 Thumbprint Already Taken: JWK already registered by another device
400 Bad Request: Invalid request format or missing required fields
429 Too Many Requests: Rate limit exceeded (nonce requests are rate-limited)
Troubleshooting Tips:

Missing kid field: Ensure your JWT header includes the kid field matching your registered JWK
Invalid signature: Verify your private key matches the public key you registered
Clock synchronization: Ensure your device's clock is accurate (JWT includes timestamp validation)
Nonce expiration: Nonces are only valid for 5 minutes - request a new one if yours has expired
Rate limiting: Nonce requests are rate-limited to prevent abuse
Migration Guide
For New Applications or new users:

Generate an ED25519 key pair for your device
Use the PIN authentication flow (Option 1 above) to register your device and get JWT tokens
Implement the token refresh flow for ongoing authentication
Use the returned JWT in your X-Plex-Token header
To replace legacy tokens of existing applications:

Continue using your current token for now
Register your public key with your existing tokens (Option 2 above)
Generate your first JWT token using the token refresh process (Your legacy token will expire after this process)
Implement the token refresh flow for ongoing authentication
Use the returned JWT in your X-Plex-Token header
Token Refresh:

JWT tokens expire after 7 days but can be refreshed at any time, including after expiration. Use the token refresh process described above.

Traditional Token Authentication (Legacy)
You're developing an app that needs access to a user's Plex account. To do this, you'll need to get access to the user's Access Token. This document details how to check whether an Access Token is valid, and how to obtain a new one.

High-level Steps
Choose a unique app name, like "My Cool App"
Check storage for your app's Client Identifier; generate and store one if none is present.
Check storage for the user's Access Token; if present, verify its validity and carry on.
If an Access Token is missing or invalid, generate a PIN, and store its id.
Construct an Auth App url and send the user's browser there to authenticate.
After authentication, check the PIN's id to obtain and store the user's Access Token.
Detailed Steps
Choose a unique app name

The app name you choose will be visible in the user's Authorized Devices view. The name you choose should be different from any existing Plex products.

Generate a Client Identifier

The Client Identifier identifies the specific instance of your app. A random string or UUID is sufficient here. There are no hard requirements for Client Identifier length or format, but once one is generated the client should store and re-use this identifier for subsequent requests.

Verify stored Access Token validity

You can check whether a user's stored Access Token is valid by requesting user info from the plex.tv API and examining the HTTP status code of the response.

$ curl -X GET https://plex.tv/api/v2/user \
  -H 'Accept: application/json' \
  -H 'X-Plex-Product: My Cool App' \
  -H 'X-Plex-Client-Identifier: <clientIdentifier>' \
  -H 'X-Plex-Token: <userToken>'
HTTP Status Code	
200	Access Token is valid
401	Access Token is invalid
If an Access Token is invalid, it should be discarded, and new one should be obtained through the authentication process.

If plex.tv cannot be reached, or if you receive any other status code it indicates an error state, but does not indicate an invalid Access Token.

Generate a PIN

To sign a user in, the app must create a time-limited PIN. The user is then led through a process to "claim" the PIN, associating it with their account and granting the app access to the user's plex.tv account.

$ curl -X POST https://plex.tv/api/v2/pins?strong=true \
  -H 'Accept: application/json' \
  -H 'X-Plex-Product: My Cool App' \
  -H 'X-Plex-Client-Identifier: <clientIdentifier>'
Note: the strong=true header provides a longer length pin which will have a longer lifetime. This is useful in cases where the user is not expected to type in the pin themselves. If not specified, a shorter pin is created but will have a much shorter lifetime.

The response will be a JSON payload; the two important properties are id and code. Store the id locally, and use the code to construct the Auth App url.

{
  "id": 564964751,
  "code": "8lzjqnq8lye02n52jq3fqxf8e",
  …
}
Checking the PIN

There are two primary ways apps interact with the Auth App and the PIN-claiming process; Forwarding and Polling.

Forwarding is used by web-based apps. A user visits your app in their web browser, leaves your app to authenticate with Plex, and returns to your app via a forwardUrl your app provides.

Polling is used by native apps running outside of a web browser. A user indicates their intention to sign-in from within your app, and your app opens a web browser pointing to the Auth App where the user completes sign-in. Your app will periodically poll on the generated PIN until it is claimed, or it expires.

Construct the Auth App url

The user will authenticate with the plex.tv Auth App through their web browser.

If you're using the Forwarding flow, the user will be returned to your app after authenticating where you'll be able to check the created PIN to determine the user's Access Token. The forwardUrl to which the user will be returned can carry the PIN id which needs to be checked on their return to the app.

Auth App urls are encoded as parameters to the url fragment. Practically, this means that your Auth App url will be prefixed with https://app.plex.tv/auth#?; the #? at the end indicates the beginning of the url fragment, and that the content of the fragment afterwards is encoded as url parameter key-values pairs.

Append these parameters to construct the final URL.

Parameter	
clientID	Your client identifier
code	The code from the generated PIN
forwardUrl	The url to which the user will be returned after authenticating.
context%5Bdevice%5D%5Bproduct%5D	The name of your App; ex "My Cool App"
Example

https://app.plex.tv/auth#?clientID=<clientIdentifier>&code=<pinCode>&context%5Bdevice%5D%5Bproduct%5D=My%20Cool%20Plex%20App&forwardUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fmy-cool-plex-app.com
You can use the qs module to encode all necessary parameters, including the nested context parameter.

const authAppUrl =
  'https://app.plex.tv/auth#?' +
  require('qs').stringify({
    clientID: '<clientIdentifier>',
    code: '<pinCode>',
    forwardUrl: 'https://my-cool-plex-app.com',
    context: {
      device: {
        product: 'My Cool App',
      },
    },
  });
Send user's browser to constructed Auth App url

Once the Auth App URL has been constructed, send the user's browser there to authenticate.

Check PIN

If you're using the Polling flow, your app should periodically (once per second) check the PIN id to determine when the user has signed-in.

If you're using the Forwarding flow, check the stored PIN id from the PIN creation step. If the PIN has been claimed, the authToken field in the response will contain the user's Access Token you need to make API calls on behalf of the user. If authentication failed, the authToken field will remain null.

$ curl -X GET 'https://plex.tv/api/v2/pins/<pinID>' \
  -H 'Accept: application/json' \
  -H 'X-Plex-Client-Identifier: <clientIdentifier>'
Talking to PMS
Once you have a token to talk to plex.tv, you will need to obtain a different set of tokens used to talk to PMS instances.

$ curl https://clients.plex.tv/api/v2/resources?includeHttps=1&includeRelay=1&includeIPv6=1 \
  -H 'Accept: application/json' \
  -H 'X-Plex-Product: My Cool App' \
  -H 'X-Plex-Client-Identifier: <clientIdentifier>' \
  -H 'X-Plex-Token: <userToken>'
The response will be a JSON document which will contain available PMS instances, the accessToken used in communication with this PMS, and the list of connection URLs where the PMS may be contacted. Connections labeled as local should be preferred over those that are not, and relay should only be used as a last resort as bandwidth on relay connections is limited.

Ingest a transient item
This endpoint takes a file path specified in the url parameter, matches it using the scanner's match mechanism, downloads rich metadata, and then ingests the item as a transient item (without a library section). In the case where the file represents an episode, the entire tree (show, season, and episode) is added as transient items. At this time, movies and episodes are the only supported types, which are gleaned automatically from the file path. Note that any of the parameters passed to the metadata details endpoint (e.g. includeExtras=1) work here.

Get library matches
The matches endpoint is used to match content external to the library with content inside the library. This is done by passing a series of semantic "hints" about the content (its type, name, or release year). Each type (e.g. movie) has a canonical set of minimal required hints. This ability to match content is useful in a variety of scenarios. For example, in the DVR, the EPG uses the endpoint to match recording rules against airing content. And in the cloud, the UMP uses the endpoint to match up a piece of media with rich metadata. The endpoint response can including multiple matches, if there is ambiguity, each one containing a score from 0 to 100. For somewhat historical reasons, anything over 85 is considered a positive match (we prefer false negatives over false positives in general for matching). The guid hint is somewhat special, in that it generally represents a unique identity for a piece of media (e.g. the IMDB ttXXX) identifier, in contrast with other hints which can be much more ambiguous (e.g. a title of Jane Eyre, which could refer to the 1943 or the 2011 version). Episodes require either a season/episode pair, or an air date (or both). Either the path must be sent, or the show title

Get a media part
Get a media part for streaming or download.

streaming: This is the default scenario. Bandwidth usage on this endpoint will be guaranteed (on the server's end) to be at least the bandwidth reservation given in the decision. If no decision exists, an ad-hoc decision will be created if sufficient bandwidth exists. Clients should not rely on ad-hoc decisions being made as this may be removed in the future.
download: Indicated if the query parameter indicates this is a download. Bandwidth will be prioritized behind playbacks and will get a fair share of what remains.

Get library sections (main Media Provider Only)
A library section (commonly referred to as just a library) is a collection of media. Libraries are typed, and depending on their type provide either a flat or a hierarchical view of the media. For example, a music library has an artist > albums > tracks structure, whereas a movie library is flat. Libraries have features beyond just being a collection of media; for starters, they include information about supported types, filters and sorts. This allows a client to provide a rich interface around the media (e.g. allow sorting movies by release year).

Notes

Technically square brackets are not allowed in an URI except the Internet Protocol Literal Address
RFC3513: A host identified by an Internet Protocol literal address, version 6 [RFC3513] or later, is distinguished by enclosing the IP literal within square brackets ("[" and "]"). This is the only place where square bracket characters are allowed in the URI syntax.
Escaped square brackets are allowed, but don't render well

The server can notify clients in real-time of a wide range of events, from library scanning, to preferences being modified, to changes to media, and many other things. This is also the mechanism by which activity progress is reported.

Two protocols for receiving the events are available: EventSource (also known as SSE), and WebSocket.

Connect to Eventsource
Connect to the event source to get a stream of events

Authorizations:
user_token
query Parameters
filter	
Array of strings
By default, all events except logs are sent. A rich filtering mechanism is provided to allow clients to opt into or out of each event type using the filters parameter. For example:

filters=-log: All event types except logs (the default).
filters=foo,bar: Only the foo and bar event types.
filters=: All events types.
filters=-foo,bar: All event types except foo and bar.

Provider
Media providers are the starting points for the entire Plex Media Server media library API. It defines the paths for the groups of endpoints. The /media/providers should be the only hard-coded path in clients when accessing the media library. Non-media library endpoints are outside the scope of the media provider. See the description in See the section in API Info for more information on how to use media providers.

Search
The search feature within a media provider

Search Hub
Perform a search and get the result as hubs

This endpoint performs a search across all library sections, or a single section, and returns matches as hubs, split up by type. It performs spell checking, looks for partial matches, and orders the hubs based on quality of results. In addition, based on matches, it will return other related matches (e.g. for a genre match, it may return movies in that genre, or for an actor match, movies with that actor).

In the response's items, the following extra attributes are returned to further describe or disambiguate the result:

reason: The reason for the result, if not because of a direct search term match; can be either:
section: There are multiple identical results from different sections.
originalTitle: There was a search term match from the original title field (sometimes those can be very different or in a foreign language).
<hub identifier>: If the reason for the result is due to a result in another hub, the source hub identifier is returned. For example, if the search is for "dylan" then Bob Dylan may be returned as an artist result, an a few of his albums returned as album results with a reason code of artist (the identifier of that particular hub). Or if the search is for "arnold", there might be movie results returned with a reason of actor
reasonTitle: The string associated with the reason code. For a section reason, it'll be the section name; For a hub identifier, it'll be a string associated with the match (e.g. Arnold Schwarzenegger for movies which were returned because the search was for "arnold").
reasonID: The ID of the item associated with the reason for the result. This might be a section ID, a tag ID, an artist ID, or a show ID.
This request is intended to be very fast, and called as the user types.

Authorizations:
user_token
query Parameters
query
required
string
The query term

sectionId	
integer
Example: sectionId=1
This gives context to the search, and can result in re-ordering of search result hubs.

Voice Search Hub
Perform a search tailored to voice input and get the result as hubs

This endpoint performs a search specifically tailored towards voice or other imprecise input which may work badly with the substring and spell-checking heuristics used by the /hubs/search endpoint. It uses a Levenshtein distance heuristic to search titles, and as such is much slower than the other search endpoint. Whenever possible, clients should limit the search to the appropriate type.

Results, as well as their containing per-type hubs, contain a distance attribute which can be used to judge result quality.

Authorizations:
user_token
query Parameters
query
required
string
The query term

type	
integer
Example: type=8

Playlist
The playlist feature within a media provider Playlists are ordered collections of media. They can be dumb (just a list of media) or smart (based on a media query, such as "all albums from 2017"). They can be organized in (optionally nesting) folders. Retrieving a playlist, or its items, will trigger a refresh of its metadata. This may cause the duration and number of items to change.

Retrieve Playlists
Gets a list of playlists and playlist folders for a user. General filters are permitted, such as sort=lastViewedAt:desc. A flat playlist list can be retrieved using type=15 to limit the collection to just playlists.

Authorizations:
user_token
query Parameters
playlistType	
string
Enum: "audio" "video" "photo"
Limit to a type of playlist

smart	
integer
Enum: 0 1
Type of playlists to return, smart or not. When not provided, will return both.

Retrieve Playlist
Gets detailed metadata for a playlist. A playlist for many purposes (rating, editing metadata, tagging), can be treated like a regular metadata item: Smart playlist details contain the content attribute. This is the content URI for the generator. This can then be parsed by a client to provide smart playlist editing.

Retrieve Playlist Contents
Gets the contents if a playlist. Should be paged by clients via standard mechanisms. By default leaves are returned (e.g. episodes, movies). In order to return other types you can use the type parameter. For example, you could use this to display a list of recently added albums vis a smart playlist. Note that for dumb playlists, items have a playlistItemID attribute which is used for deleting or moving items.

Play Queue
The playqueue feature within a media provider A play queue represents the current list of media for playback. Although queues are persisted by the server, they should be regarded by the user as a fairly lightweight, an ephemeral list of items queued up for playback in a session. There is generally one active queue for each type of media (music, video, photos) that can be added to or destroyed and replaced with a fresh queue. Play Queues has a region, which we refer to in this doc (partially for historical reasons) as "Up Next". This region is defined by playQueueLastAddedItemID existing on the media container. This follows iTunes' terminology. It is a special region after the currently playing item but before the originally-played items. This enables "Party Mode" listening/viewing, where items can be added on-the-fly, and normal queue playback resumed when completed. You can visualize the play queue as a sliding window in the complete list of media queued for playback. This model is important when scaling to larger play queues (e.g. shuffling 40,000 audio tracks). The client only needs visibility into small areas of the queue at any given time, and the server can optimize access in this fashion. All created play queues will have an empty "Up Next" area - unless the item is an album and no key is provided. In this case the "Up Next" area will be populated by the contents of the album. This is to allow queueing of multiple albums - since the 'Add to Up Next' will insert after all the tracks. This means that If you're creating a PQ from an album, you can only shuffle it if you set key. This is due to the above implicit queueing of albums when no key is provided as well as the current limitation that you cannot shuffle a PQ with an "Up Next" area. The play queue window advances as the server receives timeline requests. The client needs to retrieve the play queue as the “now playing” item changes. There is no play queue API to update the playing item.

Create a play queue
Makes a new play queue for a device. The source of the playqueue can either be a URI, or a playlist. The response is a media container with the initial items in the queue. Each item in the queue will be a regular item but with playQueueItemID - a unique ID since the queue could have repeated items with the same ratingKey. Note: Either uri or playlistID must be specified

Authorizations:
user_token
query Parameters
uri	
string
The content URI for what we're playing.

playlistID	
integer
the ID of the playlist we're playing.

type

shuffle	
integer
Enum: 0 1
Whether to shuffle the playlist, defaults to 0.

repeat	
integer
Enum: 0 1
If the PQ is bigger than the window, fill any empty space with wraparound items, defaults to 0.

continuous	
integer
Enum: 0 1
Whether to create a continuous play queue (e.g. from an episode), defaults to 0.

extrasPrefixCount	
integer
Number of trailers to prepend a movie with not including the pre-roll. If omitted the pre-roll will not be returned in the play queue. When resuming a movie extrasPrefixCount should be omitted as a parameter instead of passing 0.

recursive	
integer
Enum: 0 1
Only applies to queues of type photo, whether to retrieve all descendent photos from an album or section, defaults to 1.

onDeck	
integer
Enum: 0 1
Only applies to queues of type show or seasons, whether to return a queue that is started on the On Deck episode if one exists. Otherwise begins the play queue on the beginning of the show or season.

Devices
Media grabbers provide ways for media to be obtained for a given protocol. The simplest ones are stream and download. More complex grabbers can have associated devices

Network tuners can present themselves on the network using the Simple Service Discovery Protocol and Plex Media Server will discover them. The following XML is an example of the data returned from SSDP. The deviceType, serviceType, and serviceId values must remain as they are in the example in order for PMS to properly discover the device. Other less-obvious fields are described in the parameters section below.
