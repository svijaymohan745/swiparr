The purpose of this file is to provide insight into the making of Swiparr, and the AI tools that has contributed to its creation and development.

Swiparr is made by humans in the sense that humans review, question, and test every line of code being committed to the code base.

Agentic AI chatbots have been, and are being, used to implement ideas, bug fixes and code refactors. When used, AI is guided by the reviewing human, which is responsible for pulling the trigger to commit changes. No AI has made any commits, pull requests nor have any "direct integration" (via an AI SDK or alike) to the code base. Between the code base and the AI agent, there is always a human reviewer and tester.

The developers of Swiparr believe in responsible AI usage, benefitting the user and developer experience.
